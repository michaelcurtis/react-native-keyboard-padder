# React Native Keyboard Padder

Avoiding the keyboard when using a ListView or ScrollView in React Native is a headache. I modified Andr3wHur5t's great react native module to be able to avoid the keyboard when using a ListView and ScrollView. Original package below.

## Disclaimer

I haven't tested this on Android. 
Entirely possible there are better ways to do this.

## Usage

Take a look at index.ios.js. I haven't created an NPM for it. So just copy keyboardpadder.js into your project as a component. It doesn't have any external dependencies.
